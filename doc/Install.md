Installation and usage
======================

Introduction
------------

This software uses qmake to build all its components. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro". 
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project 
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

In ArnLib the arnlib.prf -file contains template lines that can be used 
in the *.pro file of the application.

To use a more automated config of ArnLib and related applications,
the Qt Feature mechanism is used as default when available.
To set the feature directory following can be executed once (in Linux):
> qmake -set QMAKEFEATURES /usr/include/qtfeatures
Applications using ArnLib can now at best e.g. use:
> ARN += client
> CONFIG += arnlib
And all needed config for ArnLib is automatically loaded.

If needed edit the *.pro file to adjust 
them to your needs. Take care to select your deployment directories.

Building ArnBrowser
-------------------

The software can be built both by command line and IDE (Qt Creator).

The configuration in ArnBrowser.pro will give a starting point. 
It works well when using the same base directory for ArnLib as the application,
e.g. basedir/ArnLib and basedir/ArnBrowser. 

It's possible to include the ArnLib source in the ArnBrowser compiling by adding
ArnLibCompile to CONFIG.

Internal mDNS (ZeroConfig) is selected by adding mDnsIntern to CONFIG.

    CONFIG += ArnLibCompile
    CONFIG += mDnsIntern


### A) Unix 

> qmake <Br>
> make <Br>

Regarding ArnLib, the easiest way is to let it be placed in a standard location 
for librarys and includes, e.g. /usr/lib and /usr/include/ArnInc.

When using a shared library it's path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
"man ldconfig" (or google for it). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variable.

If you only want to check the ArnBrowser without installing ArnLib,
you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory of your local build ArnLib.
it's also possible to compile the sources together by ArnLibCompile (see above).


### B) Win32/MSVC 

Has not been tested yet ...

Check that your Qt version has been built with MSVC - not with MinGW !

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

For example MSVC with nmake:
> qmake ArnBrowser.pro <Br>
> nmake <Br>

Windows doesn't like mixing of debug and release binaries.

In windows it's possible to install the dll files together with the application binary,
as the application directory always is included in the search path for dll.


### C) Win32/MinGW 

Using Qt Creator for windows, will give you the needed tools for building a Qt project.

Check that your Qt version has been built with MinGW - not with MSVC !

Start a Shell, where Qt4 is initialized. (e.g. with
"Programs->Qt by Trolltech ...->Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt" ).
Check if you can execute "make" or something like "mingw32-make".

> qmake ArnBrowser.pro <Br>
> make <Br>

### D) MacOSX

Has not been tested yet ...

Well, the Mac is only another Unix system. So read the instructions in A).

In the recent Qt4 releases the default target of qmake is to generate
XCode project files instead of makefiles. So you might need to do the
following:
> qmake -spec macx-g++


### E) Qt Embedded

Has not been tested yet ...

To build should be as simple as for a regular Unix build.

Using ArnBrowser
----------------

The program doesn't have any command line parameters. It's assumed to run in a graphical environment.
